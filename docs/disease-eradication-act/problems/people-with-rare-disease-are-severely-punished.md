# ðŸ¤’ People With Rare Disease are Severely Punished

In the case of rare diseases, increasing the cost of treatment development to over a billion makes it impossible to recover your investment from a small number of patients. So rare disease patients suffer the most severe harm from the added regulatory burden on development.

## Rare Disease Statistics

- There are more than 7,000 known rare diseases affecting between 25-30 million Americans ([National Institutes of Health](https://rarediseases.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RDD-FAQ-2019.pdf))
- Globally, rare diseases affect 400 million people worldwide ([Global Genes](https://globalgenes.org/rare-disease-facts/))
- Only a few hundred rare diseases have safe, effective treatments ([National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences](http://ncats.nih.gov/research/our-impact/our-impact-rare-diseases))
- The average time to diagnose a rare disease is 4.8 years, with patients seeing an average of 7.3 physicians before receiving a correct diagnosis ([National Organization for Rare Disorders](https://rarediseases.org/understanding-rare-disease/rare-disease-facts-and-statistics/))
