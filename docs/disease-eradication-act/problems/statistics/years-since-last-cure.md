The last time medical science discovered a complete cure for a disease was in 1980, when the [World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated](https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox). This represents a significant gap in breakthrough medical cures, despite continued research and development in the pharmaceutical industry.

While there have been significant advances in treatments and vaccines for many diseases since 1980, complete cures that eliminate diseases entirely remain elusive. The last disease to be eradicated was smallpox, achieved through a global vaccination campaign.

Several factors contribute to the slow pace of developing cures:

1. **Profitability Challenges**: Pharmaceutical companies often [prioritize treatments over cures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7872909/) because chronic treatments provide ongoing revenue streams, while cures are one-time treatments. This creates a financial disincentive for developing curative therapies.

2. **High Development Costs**: Developing new cures requires significant investment in research and clinical trials, with no guarantee of success. The [average cost to develop a new drug](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126) is estimated at $1.6 billion, with only about 12% of drugs that enter clinical trials ultimately gaining FDA approval.

3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: Strict safety and efficacy requirements, while necessary, can slow down the approval process for new cures. The [average time from discovery to market approval](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126) is 10-15 years, with clinical trials alone taking 6-7 years on average.

4. **Rare Disease Focus**: Many potential cures target rare diseases, which have smaller patient populations and may be considered [unprofitable without government incentives](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126) like the Orphan Drug Act, which provides tax credits and market exclusivity for rare disease treatments.
