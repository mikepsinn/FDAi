From initial research to clinical practice, new medical treatments take an average of [17 years](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/) to complete the development process and reach patients. This lengthy timeline is due to several critical bottlenecks in traditional clinical trials:

* Patient recruitment challenges
* Geographic limitations requiring travel to specific trial sites
* Bureaucratic overhead and complex regulatory requirements
* Inefficient manual data collection processes

## Impact on Patient Lives

This extensive timeline means:
* Patients endure nearly two decades of waiting for potentially life-saving treatments
* Many patients may not survive long enough to benefit from new treatments
* Medical progress is severely bottlenecked by process inefficiencies
