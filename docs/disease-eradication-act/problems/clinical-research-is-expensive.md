# 💰 Clinical Research is Expensive

#### The Cost of Clinical Research

* It costs [$1.6 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311) to bring a drug to market (including failed attempts).
* The process takes over 10 years.
* It costs [$36k](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001) per subject in Phase III clinical trials.
* Nearly 85% of clinical trials experience delays, costing [$600,000 to $8 million](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220113005740/en/New-Study-Decentralized-Clinical-Trials-Can-Achieve-Net-Financial-Benefits-of-5X-to-14X-Due-to-Reduced-Trial-Timelines-and-Other-Factors) per day of delay.
* The mean cost of the clinical phase per drug candidate is estimated at [$117.4 million](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820562).

#### Detailed Cost Breakdown

Current major cost centers in traditional clinical trials:

* 🏥 Clinical Procedures: [$5.9M](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) for trial procedures
* 🏢 Site Overhead: [$7.4M](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) for operational costs
* 👥 Administrative Staff: [$7.2M](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) for trial management
* 📊 Site Monitoring: [$4.5M](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) for oversight
* 👨‍⚕️ Medical Staff: [$4.3M](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) combined for physicians and nurses
* 🧪 Laboratory Costs: [$2.3M](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) for tests and analysis
* 🔍 Source Data Verification: [$1.5M](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) for data validation

These costs add up to over [$56 million](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-barriers-drug-development-0) per trial, with additional miscellaneous expenses bringing the total even higher.

#### Cost-Saving Opportunities in Current System

* A 10% improvement in predicting failure before clinical trials could save [$100 million](https://drugwonks.com/blog/the-dog-days-of-drug-approvals) in development costs.
* Shifting 5% of clinical failures from Phase III to Phase I reduces out-of-pocket costs by [$15 to $20 million](https://drugwonks.com/blog/the-dog-days-of-drug-approvals).
* Shifting failures from Phase II to Phase I would reduce out-of-pocket costs by [$12 to $21 million](https://drugwonks.com/blog/the-dog-days-of-drug-approvals).

## 💡 Solution: Decentralized Automated Clinical Trials

With a decentralized autonomous FDA, we can automate clinical trials, reducing the cost and time it takes to bring new drugs to market.

This could reduce the cost of clinical trials by [90% from $56 million to under $2.4 million](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) per treatment.

#### Proven Benefits of Decentralization

* In Phase II studies, decentralized clinical trials (DCT) produce a [400%](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) return on investment in trial cost reductions.
* In Phase III studies, decentralization shows an even more dramatic [1300%](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) return on investment.
* Patient recruitment timelines can be reduced from [12 months to 3 months](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) through at-home testing options.

#### Specific Cost Reductions Through Automation

* 🏥 Clinical Procedures: [Reduced to $1M](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) through existing healthcare infrastructure and automated scheduling
* 👨‍⚕️ Medical Staff: [Reduced to $250K](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) ($150K for nurses/research associates, $100K for physicians) with AI-assisted monitoring
* 🧪 Laboratory: [Reduced to $500K](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) using local labs and automated result reporting
* 💾 Data Management: [Reduced to $10K](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) through automated collection and AI analysis, with minimal human validation
* 🤝 Patient Recruitment: [Reduced to $15K](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) via EHR integration and automated matching
* ✅ IRB Approvals: [Reduced to $5K](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) with AI-generated protocols and built-in ethical considerations
* 📊 Site Monitoring: [Eliminated](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) through automated data monitoring and blockchain-like data integrity

Most site-related costs (recruitment: $849K, retention: $4.5M, overhead: $7.4M) are completely eliminated in the decentralized model. The total cost reduction is from [$56 million to approximately $2 million](https://www.dfda.earth/#cost-savings) per trial, representing a 96% decrease in total trial costs.
