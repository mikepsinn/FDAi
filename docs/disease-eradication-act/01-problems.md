# Major Problems in Current Disease Research & Healthcare Systems

1. **Profit Misalignment**
   - Chronic disease treatment is more profitable than cures
   - Continuous treatment yields predictable revenue, discouraging investment in permanent cures
   - Prevention is undervalued financially

2. **Inefficient & Expensive Clinical Trials**
   - Trials cost up to $2.6B per new drug
   - Can take 10-17 years to complete
   - Traditional trial methods have high administrative overhead

3. **Data Fragmentation & Interoperability**
   - No unified, standard clinical trial database
   - EHR silos prevent unified analyses
   - Privacy laws restrict critical data flows
   - Inconsistent data formats slow research progress

4. **Research Funding Inefficiencies**
   - Bureaucratic NIH funding processes
   - Large allocations often yield slow progress
   - Poor oversight of high-risk research
   - Limited funding for prevention and early detection

5. **Restrictive Trial Access**
   - Up to 80-85% of real-world patients excluded from trials
   - 80% of trials delayed due to inadequate enrollment
   - Rural/underserved patients often excluded
   - 97% of willing patients unable to participate

6. **Economic Model Problems**
   - No mechanism to reward health savings from cures
   - Healthcare systems rarely invest in future cost savings
   - Volume-based incentives misaligned with patient outcomes
   - Prevention systematically undervalued

7. **Rare Disease & Personalized Medicine Gaps**
   - Underinvestment in smaller patient populations
   - Less profit potential for rare diseases
   - High costs for personalized therapies
   - System favors mass-market drugs over innovative or niche cures
