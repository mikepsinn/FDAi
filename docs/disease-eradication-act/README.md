# Disease Eradication Act

This is a collaborative blueprint for a world without disease.  Please help us improve it!

## Findings and Overview

[**2 billion**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/noncommunicable-diseases) people are suffering from over [**7000 diseases**](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/using-ai-to-repurpose-existing-drugs-for-treatment-of-rare-diseases/) because the current system is too slow, expensive and imprecise.

[**95%**](https://ncats.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NCATS_RareDiseasesFactSheet.pdf) of diseases have 0 FDA-approved treatments.  

We have not cured a single disease in the last [**44 years**](https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox).

Of diseases that do have treatments, the **[$1.6 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311)** cost to get a drug to market falls on the patients making treatments completely unaffordable without insurance. 

If a cure is discovered, [**85%**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985) of patients will be unable to participate in clinical trials due to exclusion criteria, distance, or other reasons. This means that we can't know if treatments are safe and effective for the patients who will actually be taking them.  

Because it's so hard to participate, approximately [80%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7342339/) of clinical trials are delayed or closed because of problems with recruitment.

This also means that even after 2 years of safety testing, patients have to continue to **suffer and/or die for [15 years](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/)** waiting to get through the rest of the bureaucracy and become generally prescribed.

This assumes that it will ever get to market. If a treatment can't recover the [$1.6 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311) cost, it won't even be developed.

Even if people will pay [$1.6 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311) for the treatment, a pharma company with an existing inferior treatment will likely buy the patent and put it in the closet to protect existing revenues.

## The solution:

Imagine if we could reduce the cost of new treatments by [95%](https://dfda.earth#cost-savings) and make them accessible to patients a decade sooner?

**We can!**

For less than 1% of the FDA's $7B annual budget, we can upgrade FDA.gov to provide a global decentralized clinical trial platform and give ALL patients ANYWHERE the right to effortlessly participate in decentralized clinical trials.

## How it works:

Create a [Decentralized FDA](https://dfda.earth) where:

1. You enter your condition


2. See a ranked list of the most promising treatments based on the entire universe of clinical and real-world evidence
3. You click to join a trial
4. You get the treatment shipped, labs scheduled, and report outcomes
5. The data is used to continually improve the rankings!

# Benefits:

1. Treatment decisions based on the entire universe of clinical and real-world evidence instead of vague intuition
2. [95%](https://dfda.earth#cost-savings) reduction in the cost of new treatments
3. Over [20X](https://dfda.earth#cost-savings) acceleration in the pace of medical discovery
4. Thousands of treatments that wouldn't have been profitable before can now be developed!
5. Patients get access to the most promising treatments [15 years](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/) sooner!

## Making it happen

### But how do we get it implemented?

Historically the support of only about [3.5% of a population](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/carr/publications/35-rule-how-small-minority-can-change-world) is needed to create successful social change. 

Globally, approximately [one in three](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6214883/) of all adults suffer from multiple chronic conditions (MCCs).

This means reforms only require support of 1 in 10 of people they would benefit. 

The challenge is getting them to coalesce in a single unified effort. 

This requires coordination and incentives. 


1. Write [The Global Disease Eradication Act](https://github.com/DiseaseEradicationAct/disease-eradication-act)
2. Have a global referendum on it
3. Educate policymakers of all nations
4. Enjoy! :)
