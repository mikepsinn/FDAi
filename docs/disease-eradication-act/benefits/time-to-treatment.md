From initial research to clinical practice, new medical treatments take an average of [17 years](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/) to complete the development process and reach patients. 

Phase 1 clinical trials are used to determine the safety and effects of a new drug. These take 1-2 years.

At this point, it should be possible for patients to join a trials for the treatments with the most promise.

Through automation of administrative tasks, AI-assisted protocol development, and decentralized trial management, we can dramatically compress this timeline.

This acceleration means potentially life-saving treatments reach patients faster while maintaining rigorous safety standards through automated monitoring and real-time data analysis.
